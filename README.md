# vueComponents
An amount of vue components based on PrimeVue, just configurable with some props for quick and easy use.  
I'm using these components in my own projects and update them throughout my development-lifecycle and will update them in this project.

# Disclaimer
This project is currently not meant to be added as third party package.  
The package.json is only for reference to the used packages to build these components.  
Feel free do copy these components into you project.

# Current set of components
- Form fields
- Toaster
- Localstorage

# Future updates
This project will add more as I development more and need specific components, the following list is about what I will definitely add.
- Table

# Localization
Im using vue-i18n as my localization, so i can easily configure "key-words" for some messages in my project.
Feel free to ignore it and just use a default text in your messages.

# How to use
In every component is a docstring in the beginning, explaining how to use them generally.  
Every property you can set is explained as well.
